      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Pang Siang Lian. I come from a finance and operations background and am currently transitioning into data and applied machine learning—with a strong focus on real-world impact and systems thinking.</p>
      <p>I'm completing the <strong>Graduate Diploma in Systems Analysis</strong> at <strong>NUS-ISS</strong>, and interning at <strong>Tzu Chi Foundation Singapore</strong> as a Data Analytics Intern.</p>

      <h2>Current Project: Cashflow Analytics & ML Automation</h2>
      <p>At Tzu Chi, I lead an end-to-end analytics and automation project for Finance and Ops. I built a complete data pipeline—from ingesting raw bank statements and payment gateway data, to curated SQL tables, Python-based ETL processes, and Power BI dashboards for daily cashflow visibility.</p>
      <p>I also implemented a machine learning classification model to auto-label incoming transactions—reducing manual effort while retaining human-in-the-loop review.</p>
      <p><strong>What I enjoyed most:</strong> designing systems that work in messy, real-world environments, collaborating with non-technical stakeholders, and ensuring the solution is maintainable even with limited resources.</p>

      <h2>Why AIAP</h2>
      <p>I’m applying to the AI Apprenticeship Programme to formalise my transition into applied AI, deepen my skills in production-grade ML, and learn to build models that thrive beyond notebooks.</p>
      <p>I’m especially interested in tabular, operational, and decision-driven ML problems—where I believe the most meaningful impact lies.</p>

      <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
      <p>I aim to become a finance-domain AI practitioner who can bridge business, data, and engineering. I want to bring ML into operational and financial domains where systems thinking and sustainability matter just as much as accuracy.</p>
